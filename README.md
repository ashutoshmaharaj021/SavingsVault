# Savings Vault

## Overview
Savings Vault is a simple Ethereum smart contract that allows users to securely deposit and withdraw ETH without requiring input parameters. Each user has their own balance, and they can check it anytime.

## Features
- **Deposit ETH**: Users can deposit ETH into their vault.
- **Withdraw ETH**: Users can withdraw their entire balance.
- **Check Balance**: Users can check their stored ETH balance.

## How It Works
1. Deploy the contract to the Ethereum blockchain.
2. Call the `deposit` function with ETH to store funds.
3. Use `withdraw` to retrieve all deposited funds.
4. Use `checkBalance` to view your current balance.

## Functions
- `deposit()`: Deposits ETH into the user's balance.
- `withdraw()`: Withdraws the user's full balance.
- `checkBalance()`: Returns the user's current balance.

## Security Considerations
- The contract does not use external imports or constructors.
- Only the user who deposited ETH can withdraw their own funds.
- Users must withdraw their full balance at once.

## Deployment
This contract can be deployed on Ethereum-compatible networks using tools like Remix, Hardhat, or Truffle. Ensure to have enough ETH to cover gas fees.

## License
This project is open-source and available under the MIT License.
